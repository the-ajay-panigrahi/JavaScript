        An API (Application Programming Interface) is a messenger that lets two apps talk to each other and share information. An API is a common language between two systems (between frontend and backend). Basically, an API is a medium.

        we have fetch() modern way(newer).
        we have XMLHttpRequest() legacy way(older) => AJAX programming.

        XMLHttpRequest: readyState property

        Value	 State	                       Description
