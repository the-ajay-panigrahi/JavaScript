## JavaScript Playground 

This is my playground for learning JavaScript!   

I'll be throwing code snippets in here and tinkering with all sorts of concepts as I go.

In other words, expect some quirky code and unforeseen adventures along the way.  This is all part of the learning process, right?     

Happy coding!
