## JavaScript Playground 

This is my playground for learning JavaScript!   
I'll be throwing code snippets in here and tinkering with all sorts of concepts as I go.  
Think of it as a messy workbench ️where I experiment and unleash my JavaScript creativity (or at least try to ).

In other words, expect some quirky code and unforeseen adventures along the way.  This is all part of the learning process, right?     

Happy coding!
